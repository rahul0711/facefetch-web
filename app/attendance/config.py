"""Config for the AdaFace/SCRFD/ByteTrack/FAISS attendance pipeline.

Every tunable that affects match accuracy is read from the environment (or
this dataclass's defaults) rather than hardcoded where it's used -- see
README's "assumptions that would silently break accuracy" section for why
this matters for MATCH_THRESHOLD in particular.
