"""Orchestrates: capture -> (rate limit) -> submit every N frames to the
detection worker process -> read latest tracked result -> crop.

Detection runs in a fully separate OS process (ProcessDetectionWorker), not
just a background thread, so nothing it does -- GPU calls, NMS, box math --
can ever compete with the render loop for the GIL. The render loop always
gets the freshest captured frame immediately; detection results arrive
whenever the worker process finishes them.

Kept deliberately dumb and linear for Phase 1 (single camera, single
process). Multi-camera support (Phase 2+) means running one of these per
camera — nothing here assumes global/shared state, so that's a config change
plus a process-per-camera or asyncio-gather, not a rewrite.
