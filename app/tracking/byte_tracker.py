"""ByteTrack-based tracker for face detections.

SimpleIouTracker (single-frame IoU, no motion model) was always a Phase 1
placeholder for this -- see its module docstring. ActivityDetector already
gets motion-model tracking "for free" via Ultralytics' own YOLO.track()
(BoT-SORT), but SCRFD/InsightFace face detections never go through a YOLO
model's .track() call, so this drives Ultralytics' bundled BYTETracker
directly off raw DetectedFace boxes instead.

Why this matters for faces specifically: a person turning their head or
briefly occluding their own face (hand, cup, walking past a monitor) is
exactly the case SimpleIouTracker loses -- one skipped detection with low
box overlap on return and it's a new track_id, which resets any
recognition/voting state tied to that id. ByteTrack's motion prediction
(Kalman filter) plus its two-stage high/low-confidence association keeps
the same id through a few missed or low-confidence frames instead.
